  # MVC First Attempt

  ## Description

  This project was made to  practice creating a functional website from top to bottom on my own using a database / handlebars. It currently has no handlebars or UI in any capacity which will hopefully be changed in the future. It is supposed to be a website / blog that would allow users to create and account / login / post / view posts / logout. Most of the back end code should be functional with the exception of adding functionality to the webpages that are yet to exist.
